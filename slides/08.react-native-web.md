* run React Native components and APIs on web using React DOM

Note: You can reuse up to 100% of the code, but that doesn't mean you should. It's recommended to have some differences between platforms to make them feel more natural to the user. To do that, you can create platform-specific files ending with .web.js, .ios.js, .android.js or .native.js
 ```
