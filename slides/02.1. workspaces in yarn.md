## Monorepo in react native

### Intro and Why ?

```
Monorepos allow you to have multiple projects share common dependencies instead of installing the dependencies for each of them.
They also simplify sharing code between your projects, allowing you to import code from one package to another.
- You develop multiple projects in the same repository.
- The projects can depend on each other, so they can share code.
- When you make a change, you do not rebuild or retest every project in the monorepo. Instead, you only rebuild and retest the projects that can be affected by your change
