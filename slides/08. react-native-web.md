## Monorepo in react native

##### Fun fact with react-native-web
`
react-native-web supports most of the react-native API, but a few pieces are missing like Alert, Modal, RefreshControl and WebView;
If you come across a dependency that doesn't work well with the monorepo structure, you can add it to the nohoist list;
