## Monorepo in react native

### nohoist
`
“nohoist” enables workspaces to consume 3rd-party libraries not yet compatible with its hoisting scheme. The idea is to disable the selected modules from being hoisted to the project root. They were placed in the actual (child) project instead, just like in a standalone, non-workspaces, project.
`  

For example:
under a private project root, with nohoist:  

`"workspaces": {
  "packages": ["packages/*"],
  "nohoist": ["**/react-native", "**/react-native/**"]
}
`

under a private project root, without nohoist:  

`"workspaces": {
  "packages": ["packages/*"],
}
`

under a private child project, with nohoist:  
`
"workspaces": {
  "nohoist": ["react-native", "react-native/**"]
}
`
